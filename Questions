Questions

1. Have we understood aap.mat correctly? Theta_k in case 3??
2. Which part of the controller should we save? K?
3. How to load models and controllers into si6mulink and S-functions
4. Where to set function parameters

Sending theta from AAP does not give the correct A matrix to B, instead of [1, a1, a2 ...] we get [1, 1, a1, a2...]
